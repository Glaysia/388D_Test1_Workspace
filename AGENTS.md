# Agent Notes

## Project Expectations
- This workspace uses CCS/Eclipse project files (`.project`, `.cproject`). Do not introduce a new build system unless asked.
- Source layout is `core/c`, `core/cc`, and `core/asm`. Keep C and C++ separated to avoid compiler mode issues.
- Keep linker command files (`*.cmd`) at the project root; CCS configs reference them there.

## Change Safety
- Do not change file extensions from `.c` to `.cc` (or vice versa) unless the code is verified for that language.
- C++ builds are stricter (e.g., no implicit `void *` to typed pointer conversions).
- `.settings` files can be user- or workspace-specific. Ask before committing changes to them.

## Tooling
- `compile_commands.json` is generated by CCS under `CPU*_RAM/.clangd/` after a build.
- Follow the `.gitignore` for build outputs and generated files.
